## Theme
The theme is based on Vue's theme from [Vue.org](https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org)

Many thanks to the developers (L)

## Developing

``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm start # dev server at http://localhost:4000
```

## Language
We developed the framework to cover our own needs but instead of keeping it for our selves we decided to make it public, who knows! maybe someone in somewhere has the same need as us.

But unfortunately, our resources are very limited and we must prioritize so, for now, we are focusing on documenting the framework for our developers in our mother language.

But anyone could contribute translating or make a request for translation..\
